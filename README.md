Smart Glove is an ESP32-based wearable device that operates in two modes: a Sign-to-Text mode that converts hand signs into English alphabets, and a Gesture Control mode where a few predefined hand gestures are used to control the arrow keys of a PC. The system uses low cost DIY touch sensors for touch detection.
