## Description
Smart Glove is an ESP32-based wearable device that operates in two modes: a Sign-to-Text mode that converts hand signs into English alphabets, and a Gesture Control mode where a few predefined hand gestures are used to control the arrow keys of a PC. The system uses low cost DIY touch sensors for touch detection.
## Features
### Sign to text conversion
Detects specific hand sign patterns and prints the corresponding English alphabet.
### Gesture Control
Controls PC functions using gestures (scrolling, navigation etc.)
### DIY touch sensors
Simple aluminium based DIY touch sensors for low-cost and high responsiveness.
